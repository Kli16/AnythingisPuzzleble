<h3> Project Description </h3>
<p> Trappy InStuyde is a “choose your own adventure” game, similar in style to the
text-based game The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. This adventure follows a Stuyvesant Junior as they make their way through the school from the 10th floor down to the second, completing puzzles and roadblocks along the way. All paths eventually lead, however, to the inevitable, and with accumulated Keys to Success, Energy, and GPA points, one faces the final boss, a battleship game against Mr. Brown Mykolyk.
