OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We ended up finishing the project which considering the time restraints that all of us had throughtout the project was difficult to achieve. 
Till now none of us have ever written a project with so many files in it

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Would have wanted to make Battleship more and made the AI smarter
COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow! oo!...

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We lowered the amount of puzzles in the game so that we could make sure that we had time to write all of them with a decent amount of creativity and plot entanglement
Changed the function of Keys to Success, mainly due to time restraint

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quality and Polish and Robustness should always go above quantity, especially under a tight time limit
